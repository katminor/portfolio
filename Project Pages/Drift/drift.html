                    <p><strong>What is Drift?</strong><br>
                        Drift, a B2B company, facilitates connections between
                        businesses and prospective customers when their intent to buy is at its highest. By linking
                        Sales Representatives with visitors when they're exploring pricing options and offering
                        insights into their browsing behavior, Drift enables personalized sales. This approach
                        leads to quicker and more effective sales.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>What did I do?</strong><br>
                    <p>To address low Drift Mobile usage, I conducted
                        extensive user research and created a fully functional prototype in Figma.
                        Through 12 in-depth interviews, I identified missing features that prevented more widespread
                        Drift Mobile
                        adoption. <span class="highlight">My insights drove increased usage, enabling sales teams to

                    Drift Desktop, leading to a lack of use. I looked at usage data to see what the most used
                    features were and made those easiest to access via the actions bar.</p>

                    on mobile but heavily utilized on desktop. I introduced a solution that allows users and

                <p>Every single day, hundreds of thousands of slash commands are used on Drift Desktop. Yet, this
                    functionality is not available on Drift Mobile. This feature helps users quickly access
                    key information. Without it, the process of making a sale is much slower. In order to prevent
                    this issue, I added this functionality to Drift Mobile.</p>

                <p>Understanding the customer is a key component to making a sale. If you can understand
                    the needs of the customer, you can sell them what they want quickly. On Drift Desktop, it's easy
                    to see the entire account's history in order to decide the next move. However, on Drift Mobile,
                    this view is much more complex. I simplified this view in order to make it easier to parse

                            where some representatives find it necessary to send files or images to potential clients.
                            This capability is also a common feature in other mobile chat platforms and is readily
                            available on Drift Desktop. To ensure that representatives have a consistent experience

                            meeting on the calendar, initiate a Zoom meeting, or make a phone call becomes crucial.
                            Ensuring that these features are accessible on mobile is not only vital for Sales

                            the funniest messages they've received from people online. In these scenarios, blocking and
                            leaving the conversation is typically the best course of action. These options are located

                            dismiss these ads without giving them a second thought. I demonstrated how these
                            advertisements would appear within the Feed, Chat, and Videos page. My objective was to show
                            that you can complete the same parts of your workflow on Drift Desktop on Drift Mobile. </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>My experience with Drift Mobile taught me the importance of considering the context
                            in which mobile apps are used. Users often turn to the mobile app for quick access
                            to smaller interactions. This led me to adopt a mindset centered around speed and
                            efficiency, focusing on reducing the number of clicks and the time required for
                            users to reach their desired page/feature. This newfound mentality will undoubtedly
                            influence my approach in future projects, emphasizing user-centric design that
                            caters to the specific needs of mobile users.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>It was so helpful to have usage data to help me define the core features! Due to
                            this, I spent considerable amount of time refining 'saved replies' and 'slash
                            commands' since they were expected to be heavily used. While I initially iterated on
                            'saved replies' for mobile, I made it so that users could create their own saved
                            replies on mobile. However, I later realized it might not be a common mobile
                            feature. This experience reinforced my belief in prioritizing high-impact features,
                            which I plan to apply in future projects.</p>

                        <p>Initially, Drift Mobile was very limited. Certain components that were required for
                            designing Drift Mobile did not exist. To address this gap, I undertook the task of
                            creating these components and then incorporated the new mobile components into the
                            Design System for future designers. This process provided valuable insights into how
                            to transition user experiences from desktop to mobile. I believe that this knowledge
                            will prove beneficial in future designs.</p>
