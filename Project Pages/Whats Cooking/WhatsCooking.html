                    <p>"What's Cooking?" is a multiplayer asymmetric cooperative game where players must serve hungry customers in an out of the ordinary kitchen. Ingredients and serving plates come out on two separate conveyor belts, chefs need to grab what's necessary before it's gone. With all the mayhem, communication is key. Players must balance the wants of their customers, the feedback from their fellow chefs (whether they be AI or human), and the speed of the conveyor belts. Ultimately, players must serve all of the customers with as few mistakes as they can.</p>

                        <p>At the time of this project, AI was still an emerging technology. ChatGPT had just come out and the thought of an AI team member seemed far out of reach. However, considering the potential benefits of having an AI team member, a question arises: How would be the most effective way to communicate with them? We wanted to explore how we can facilitate effective communication between human and AI players.</p>

                        <h3>My Solution</h3>
                        <p>Wanting to keep the subjectivity of language while still making it easy for everyone to understand, I created a symbol-based system that would make it easy for both players and AI to communicate with one another. Given the time-sensitive nature of the game, quick communication was important, so using symbols instead of words made it much easier to communicate.</p>

They just wanted to get the items they needed without any extra complications. Taking this feedback into account, I refined the prototype to make the process simpler, focusing on straightforward item requests.</p>

                    <p class="text-container">In the second iteration, I decided to simplify the urgency system to just two distinct states: a "!" to indicate urgency and a "?" to represent a request for item location. However, during playtesting, I noticed that players often used these two communication points in similar ways, resulting in confusion and misinterpretation.<br><br>

                        I also considered incorporating a spinning wheel to reduce the space the communication system took up, which would allow players to quickly indicate the specific food they were referring to. This change was aimed at making it faster and more precise. Additionally, I introduced the concept of a map within the communication system, giving players a visual representation of their position within the kitchen system.</p>
